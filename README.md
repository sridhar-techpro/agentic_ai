### Multi-Agent Stock Market Analysis System
Overview
This repository implements a Multi-Agent Stock Market Analysis System using different agentic AI frameworks, including:

Crew AI

Autogen

Langflow

(More frameworks can be added as needed)

Each implementation follows the same core functionality to allow for a direct comparison of the frameworks' capabilities.

Use Case
🚀 A multi-agent AI system for stock market analysis and investment reporting, leveraging:

Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) for real-time & historical stock data.

Technical Analysis (Moving Averages, RSI, MACD).

AI-driven Investment Insights & Reports.

Poetry for package management.

Modular & Extensible Design to support different agentic AI frameworks.

Framework Implementations
Each framework has its own subdirectory:

Framework	Status	Description
Crew AI	✅ Implemented	Multi-agent collaboration for stock analysis & reporting
Autogen	🚧 In Progress	AutoGPT-based multi-agent system
Langflow	📝 Planned	Visual workflow for stock market AI agents

Observations & Findings
This section will be updated as implementations progress, focusing on:

Performance (speed, accuracy, scalability)

Ease of Use (developer experience, learning curve)

Flexibility (customization, integrations)

Conclusion
By comparing multiple frameworks, this project aims to determine the best approach for building a multi-agent AI system for stock market analysis.
